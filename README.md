# roboClimberRGB

This code controls two light bars mounted on my FRC team's (1732 Hilltoppers) compitition robot.
At the system's heart is an ATMEGA328p (Arduino Nano). WS2812B LED strips were soldered together in two chians of six.

Control commands came from the robot RoboRIO digital IO pins. Three pins were used, for a total of 8 different lighting sequences, though only 6/8 were used.
